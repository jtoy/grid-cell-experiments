# grid-cell-experiments


Goal: Get a deeper understanding of using deepmind's grid cell paper. Can we reproduce the experiments and graphs? If we get a deep understanding of the system, we may be able to produce our own experiments.


Technology: 
We will port it to Python 3 and pytorch.




Potential modifications:
Can we 
The path integration


Next steps:
1 private github repo of copy deepmind
2 Private Github repo new code
3 repurpose the data set
4 exploratory code to examine the dataset

Design doc:
training loop
Validation procedures
Visualization 


@tomek can you look at your schedule to see if we could meet twice a week?  I can do almost any days/times.
