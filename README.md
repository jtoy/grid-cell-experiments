# grid-cell-experiments

### Running:

Install dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run training loop:

```sh
python -m gridcells.main
```

Use tensorboard to monitor progrss:

```sh
tensorboard --logdir=tmp/tensorboard --host=0.0.0.0
```

### Development

Pre-commit hooks with forced pytahon formatting ([black](https://github.com/psf/black), [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/), and [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/)):

```sh
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

Whenever you execute `git commit` the files altered / added within the commit will be checked and corrected. `black` and `isort` can modify files locally - if that happens you have to `git add` them again.
You might also be prompted to introduce some fixes manually.

To run the hooks against all files without running `git commit`:

```sh
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Goal: Get a deeper understanding of using deepmind's grid cell paper. Can we reproduce the experiments and graphs? If we get a deep understanding of the system, we may be able to produce our own experiments.



Potential modifications:
* Can we implement our own trajectories with an artifical agent
* can we change out the model to use transformers
* can we use other forms of attention

# next steps:

* encoding from 16 to 32 - number of points to quantize 2d space (decrease/increase) (e)
* turn off dropout (e)
* run small grid search across hyperparameters:
  * hyper parameter numbers (e)
  * lstm number (e)
  * different optimizers (m)

* turn off HD cells for prediction (h)
* try 3D (h)

* get the model to get as close of results to deepmind as possible
  * rmsprop is different: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/32545
  * email to deepmind/lukas
  * scoring added to report
  * datasamples, use same way as deepmind , maybe not worth it?

* seed control

# papers to review

* minimum requirements for grid cell navigation
* 3D papers
* SAC



# Questions

* What is the minimum architecture to make the grid cells appear
* what would an abstract space with cartesian coordinates look like
* why does the other paper get grid cells in different shapes
* are speed cells in the data, how would prove this
* does a regular lstm/rnn trained on simliar dataset get a similar loss
* testing out 3D, how would we generate the training data
* what is the loss representing
